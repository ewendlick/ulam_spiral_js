## What's an Ulam Spiral?
An [Ulam Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) is a number spiral with prime numbers displayed as "on". It creates some interesting quasi-patterns.

## Build instructions
You can double-click the HTML file's icon, or single-click it and press the "enter" key. Advanced users can right-click on the icon, and find the "open" option in the drop-down menu that appears. Garbage browsers are not supported.

## Usage
Change the size and color of the "pixels" by changing the consts at the top of the file.
